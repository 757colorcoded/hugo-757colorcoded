## ABOUT OUR MISSION

Software companies and those that employ tech workers continue to struggle with poor diversity numbers, going so far as to claim the talent isnâ€™t there. We aim to help talented people of color access the knowledge, resources and networks they need to build their careers.

757ColorCoded is a diverse group of technology professionals committed to being a part of the national effort to increase the presence of people of color (POC) in the tech talent space.

Our goal is to accomplish this through establishing local partnerships and initiatives that will enable us to provide career guidance and mentorship as well as free workshops, courses, scholarships and other learning tools and resources for POC in the community.
