Being an effective ally requires significant self-reflection and a strong sense of self-identity. A huge part of being an ally is self-education and making sure that you are up-to-date on the relevant issues. Any educator can become an ally, but the journey might look different depending on one's identity, experience and familiarity with issues of power and privilege.
